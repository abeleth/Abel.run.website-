***What is Devops?***

"From Amazon's standpoint, DevOps is a set of practices and cultural philosophies that enables organizations to improve collaboration between development and operations teams to automate and streamline the process of software development, deployment, and infrastructure management. At Amazon, DevOps is a key enabler of continuous innovation, allowing for faster delivery of applications, improvements, and services with a focus on customer satisfaction. Amazon emphasizes the use of AWS tools and services to automate infrastructure provisioning, continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD), and monitoring, fostering a rapid feedback loop to detect and resolve issues quickly. This approach enables teams to release software updates quickly, efficiently, and securely, maintaining high availability and reliability in a dynamic, cloud-based environment. Through practices like Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and automated testing, Amazon's DevOps culture aims to enhance operational efficiency, reduce downtime, and ensure that software aligns with customer needs and business objectives."
