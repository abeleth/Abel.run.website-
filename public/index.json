These day-to-day inventions support and grow a better society to the next level, especially when it comes to technology. IAAS, PAAS, and SAAS have the highest position in the technology world regarding infrastructure, platforms, and software. Different countries have to adapt to this technology or evolve to be one of the most powerful countries in the world, so it looks like the world is racing to master this technology. The focus of this paper is to discuss the three most essential infrastructures in cloud computing as mentioned (IAAS, PAAS, and SAAS), discuss the pros and cons of each of these infrastructures, present a focused problem within these systems, and overall explain the whys of cloud computing when it comes to why cloud computing is necessary for this day in age. When discussing cloud infrastructures, cloud users need help with why these systems must work together. This can be better explained by breaking down each system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSAAS is considered the users; they utilize the products made by the developers and architects. Platforms called PAAS make up the developers; they code and create the product. The architects are known as IAAS; they basically provide a virtual machine and storage and networking to develop the interface working hand-to-hand with PAAS. With these systems working together, networking is possible to create and manage, but human error is the real problem that needs to be focused on. These systems are not run by artificial intelligence yet, so extensive training must be implemented for employees who use these systems; that being said, data security, integration reassurance, and resource mismanagement are problem-focused factors that interfere with cloud efficiency. This presents a problem because networking and connectivity become nearly 2 impossible again, and resources (money being a prominent example) become a loss and liability. Starting with PAAS, systems that need to be integrated must be compatible with merging platforms. Non-compatible platforms can\u0026rsquo;t be incorporated, so developers need to be aware of the capabilities of their current platform before blending into a new one. SAAS users must be trained on data security, know the risks and signs of a data breach or hacker activity, run safety audits, back up data, and, most importantly, encryptions. IAAS architects will make or break the company since they handle the resources, but they face the disadvantage of resource management.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHidden costs and resource mismanagement can occur when architects need to use their better judgment; this harms the company\u0026rsquo;s revenue and time. Workloads fluctuate, and user volume can be unpredictable, which is hard to train for and predict; it comes with increasing experience to spend resources optimally. Evolving applications, preventing data breaches, and resource management are the problems that arise with these systems. PAAS, SAAS, and IAAS work together to achieve platform development, which makes it easier since actual additional hardware is not needed, eases merging issues when switching to different networks in terms of other installments while using the internet, and is user-friendly in terms of helping with infrastructure, development and application deployment respectively. The overall goal for these systems is to achieve quality resource management, high user approval of at least 90% with feedback, enhance efficiency on platforms when applications are implemented and used, and guarantee that use of the application has high user volume.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a growing infrastructure in cloud computing, it is essential to question what companies must keep in mind when integrating into these cloud service models. What challenges were faced by 3 these companies that did it? How can these systems save companies time and resources? These questions are important because they answer why these models are efficient, time-saving, and reliable overall and what to expect when integrating them into these systems. Integration can be challenging for users because they are the ones affected; they have to learn a new system and tool infrastructure, and if used improperly, it can cost companies more money. Human error and format infrastructure must fit the company\u0026rsquo;s needs for this reason, this problem extends to a company-wide margin loss and the use of resources spent unnecessarily. What has worked in past attempts to solve this problem included proper employee training, user feedback, and system-wide development to help meet company goals when deciding what tools were needed to complete tasks and projects at a low cost. If this strategy had not been used, unhappy users and profit loss would have happened, and user capacity would have exceeded the amount the infrastructure could handle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis research will help provide more context on how each system communicates between users, developers, and architects and how application integration is achieved. As previously mentioned, user error presents a significant problem when integrating cloud tools. Completing on-the-job training may be difficult because not all users may finish the training on time, may find the training difficult and time-consuming, or the fact that users may become more comfortable with using their current or previous models. Cloud computing reduces maintenance costs which provides a solution to poor management of resources (Mohammed, C. M. et. al 2021)\nLiterature Review\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn extensive literature review found that infrastructure issues are one of the most significant problems cloud computing has with PAAS, SAAS, and IAAS (Hiremath \u0026amp; Mallapur, 2021). According to the journals, many human errors will make cloud computing vulnerable to cyber attacks and make companies lose millions of dollars annually. This is one of the most significant human errors. It has been the biggest challenge in cloud infrastructure. In order to be scalable, our infrastructure on the cloud needs to be managed safely. This would lead customers to distrust the product that the provider has given. Customers have considerable doubt about any infrastructure that can be breached, even as it is (Kumar et al., 2013). The software developer PAAS and the system architect IAAS must be fully secured before they put SAAS out for the end users. Developers and the architects must make sure that you, the end user, know how to operate the system and how to set it up, so they have to put enough information on how the infrastructure works, and they have to make sure to put out enough training for the end users to experience the safety and the reliability of the product. Due to these interventions, cyber attacks can be decreased, and the expenditure of resources can be utilized more efficiently and directed towards other applications to strengthen these interfaces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese interventions will save a company millions, and the resources used for cyber attacks will not be spent (Gupta \u0026amp; Kaliyar, 2013). Cyber-hackers use many methods to attack any data for ransomware maliciously. Many companies must prevent these attacks by collaborating with their developers and end users on a protection plan. Most of these attacks can be easily preventable by using multi-authentication for AWS and authorization policies to ensure data is safe and the right users adequately trained to handle these situations are implemented in the protection plan and procedures (Nagalakshmi \u0026amp; Ali, 2015). Companies have to encourage their employees to use multi-factor authentication at all times. This will prevent many data from being stolen from the company, preventing issues and increasing security. Another method of solving the human error issue in cloud computing is through the applications of SAAS to fraudulent employee activity. End-users will be subjected to an employee attendance verification process to decrease the occurrence of employee fraud for payroll purposes and data protection. These applications enhance cyber security in cloud computing to ensure infrastructure and user satisfaction are reached (Panjaitan et al., 2023).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSAAS, PAAS, and IAAS are some of the few models that encompass cloud computing. This paper will dive deeper into each model. SAAS (Software As A Service) has become an efficient model in low-cost applications because the model charges less, has become widely available in digital marketing, and sales are very promising. Between 2018 and 2020, remote vendor transactions became common because of easy accessibility and reduced travel costs. SAAS continues to be a reputable service because of its scalability and a \u0026ldquo;pay for what you get\u0026rdquo; system. SAAS is very cost-friendly because the buyers can fit it into their budgets, and the quality of service fits everything they need for their software priorities. This service allows companies to pay more with their users and less on the software. SAAS is standard, used over the internet, and paid per user. The applications are highly reputable, and resources like Dropbox or Gmail are accessed within them.\nThis system is subscription-based, and you pay per user; therefore, if an employee is no longer working for the company, the company will not be charged for that user. The best part about SAAS is that applications can be used solely on the internet, meaning that end-users are not required to download the application in order to use the service, meaning that end-users can save on storage and file space on their computer and solely focus on their projects within the application (Van Der Kooij \u0026amp; Cespedes, 2013). The I in IAAS( Infrastructure As A Service) refers to laptops or anything that runs software; this can also be a mobile cell phone and can be run anywhere; the focus here is on infrastructure. How \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rdquo; is consumed is when these models are used \u0026ldquo;As A Service\u0026rdquo; (AAS). This section of this paper will break down IAAS. AAS represents the consumer portion of the model. Coming back to infrastructure, compute, which refers to processing, has three main compartments: compute, the second one is GPU, HPC, and the other one is storage, which includes objects, blocks, and files. These models must work with Networking in order to function and communicate properly. Compute refers to the general storage or server used to document or store any information or data. GPU is the artificial intelligence or computer learning aspect of the infrastructure. HPC is high-performance computing, the processing speed needed to transfer data and information. Storage has three main components because there are many ways data is stored. One is called Object, where documents, pictures, and other graphics are housed. Blocks are a specific storage application that attaches to specific networks and files and mounts to specific computers. In Networking, feeding data to the GPU requires a lot of communication between the block, Object, and itself. Data goes through the network pipe that is big enough to feed through; after processing through the network pipe, the GPU sends the data to block as a transcriber, and the data goes back to the GPU to learn the data going back and forth until all data is processed, once the data is cleared and processed, GPU will send the data to Object since the data fed through is typically media or documents, data is cheaply stored in Object which is why most data is stored there most commonly. Lastly, the AAS ( As A Service) portion encompasses four advantageous characteristics: everyone can use the service, what is billed can be an hourly or monthly charge at a low price, this service typically discourages long-term commitments, and once the service is purchased, it is automatically and readily available to the consumer which means that customers do not have a waiting period to use the service (Johns et. al, 2023). The final component is PAAS (Platform as A Service), a service used for applications but provides software with cloud components. This platform is a developer\u0026rsquo;s canvas where they can create apps and projects without interference from other typical infrastructures. It provides the necessary tools to complete these applications, thus making the application process more efficient and saving developers much time. PAAS is so great because programming languages, pre-built middleware services like messaging systems, and incredible authentication tools help developers make these applications efficiently and quickly. Developers won\u0026rsquo;t have to juggle creating the applications and maintaining the infrastructure configurations. Other than the advantage of scalability, developers can collaborate with other developers and work on building the application simultaneously, all while accessing and sharing data to complete the application as a team. Therefore, this platform is very user-friendly and team-oriented. PAAS is an excellent platform for new businesses to get their developers acquainted with each other and establish their team dynamic. Writing codes can be the main task for these developers (Pahl, 2015).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn general, PAAS, IAAS, and SAAS encompass cloud computing where communication, teamwork, server uses, data storage, developer tools, applications, artificial intelligence, and cost efficiency come together to make the systems we use today, such as AWS, Google Cloud, and the many other applications used to make the world of technology more scalable, available and compatible. These systems are necessary for costs to move and store data and create applications and user services to be possible today, especially with the growing population of computer applications and users. These infrastructures must work together to create a safe environment and an intense atmosphere in Cloud computing. This infrastructure makes the cloud place more interactive with developers and users, allowing them to create an infrastructure that is helpful for the future of AI. Atmosphere and communication are essential for these systems. Hopefully, in the future, users will be reassured about security issues and the fast infrastructure of the system in general.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis research paper will dive deeper into each cloud computing model. The disadvantages of IAAS, PAAS, and SAAS are discussed here. First, this report will discuss the disadvantages of SAAS Software as a service. The first disadvantage that I would like to talk about is Functionality. Some apps are relatively new and still getting updated with new technology. The Functionality Lacks accuracy and is less Futuristic than the on-premises Infrastructure. It takes time for users to adjust to the cloud service. From the user standpoint, this will make users choose or think about going forward using the on-premises platform since it has been tested and performed for a long time. The second disadvantage is cost. Cost is one of the most significant attributes of Cloud infrastructure. It might be very costly if the customer needs the proper infrastructure while building a cloud. Customers have to choose the professionals they use to build the cloud environment and have an excellent knowledge of it. To avoid this, customer should use cost management applications to save money on their projects. (Hoseini, L. (2013, September 12)\nThe other one is working because Consumers have less control over the environment they will be building on the cloud surface, and adaptability is a disadvantage because varying system updates will cause users to be acquainted with the newer versions that the Avengers put out. This will put you in a position to keep your version of the application you will be using. The other one is data security. Data security is one of the most significant disadvantages of cloud service. Your information and business ideas will be in a third-party hand in Old times. This will put companies at risk when it comes to data security. Companies must devise an excellent idea to protect their data from cyber attacks at all times. Premises platform will not make you worry when it comes to data security because, at all times, you know your data is in your hands with your secured environment. You will be losing your information in the wrong hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePAAS is also known as a Platform As A Service. Any platform with an internet connection can use PAAS. Developers can code their software over the internet and maintain infrastructure. Machine learning is also why developers use PAAS. Platform as a service is a very salable model but comes with some typical advantages that companies that use this model need to understand. Outages can decrease applications\u0026rsquo; deployment or reaction time; this is also seen in PAAS. Multiple versions of an application can be updated many times, so users need to remember the adaptability required to use this service. Resources management is critical. PAAS can typically be more expensive than IAAS. (Pahl, C. (2015, May 6)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTherefore, businesses need to research which platforms will work best with their department and have resource management in mind for this reason. Another disadvantage of using PAAS is the integration issues. Moving from vendor to vendor will be challenging because of compatibility issues. Even a company\u0026rsquo;s existing premises can become incompatible with other platforms, and data control, storage, and memory loss can occur, which will be a costly mistake. Businesses need to research when considering PAAS as a model for their application developments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInfrastructure as a service al, known in short as IAAS, is a cloud service model that allows scalability, memory, storage, networking, and many more services. Scalability is essential, especially during peak seasons such as October through December, when all the major holidays line up, and more inventory demand is prevalent. IAAS is a server in a virtual form that customers can rent out. This service helps data become more accessible, and customers can install different modes of IAAS. Private, public, and hybrid clouds will be discussed further in this research paper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStarting with Public Cloud, as hinted by the name, this service uses limited access where provisions can either be worked on by the company, a third-party organization, or both. The public cloud is also a simple form of cloud infrastructure that provides many organizations access to the infrastructure, also called a \u0026ldquo;Multi-tenant model\u0026rdquo; (n.d, CompTIA.org,2023). A combination of academic organizations, government agencies, and businesses can manage it. This submodel exists on-premises. Hybrid Cloud is just the private and public cloud leveraged to make data, storage, and other applications more transferable and compatible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese sub-models help with scalability for companies; users can increase or decrease depending on the seasons. Although IAAS presents the best advantage of scalability by allowing user capacity to change within user demand, other advantages include its cost-effectiveness by most often charging for services monthly. Unfortunately IAAS cannot always present a sound cloud servicing model. Since it is relatively new, there are a few bugs to discuss. Data breaches can occur due to human or business errors, and they cannot integrate with older systems. Downtime can occur for any size among service providers, and third parties are often used as tech support; therefore, companies need to remember that the expertise in IAAS has yet to be fully mastered (n.d, CompTIA.org,2023).\nAs discussed in this research paper, many advantages, disadvantages, and business considerations exist when using Infrastructure As A Service, Software As A Service, and Platform As A Service. These models make application development and scalability easier by compensating user volumes, storage, memory, and cost-effectiveness. These attributes keep clouding alive and help to advance this technology further in the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eResources\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAL Ladan, M.

In the IT infrastructure, businesses and developers can take many developmental approaches to provide high-quality applications and services within cloud computing. components to modern computing include scalability, applications that acquire cost effectiveness, services that include implementing invested amount of storage for these businesses, whether they are small businesses or big corporations, and allowing their applications and services to be flexible to enhance customer freedoms within their services; customers implementing their policies and procedures will allow more customer appeal to these services. What will be discussed are infrastructure as a service, platform as a service, and software as a service, which are the main cloud service models presented. To build a cloud’s computing foundation, infrastructure as a service is the provider of internet resources offered virtually. Google Cloud platform, Amazon, Web Services, and Microsoft Azure are the leading providers of infrastructure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBased on demand, resources can be increased or decreased in scalability, and businesses can only use what they paid for in terms of storage and other services. This characteristic of infrastructure as a service is called scalability. Infrastructure is a service that is cost-effective because it uses a pay-for-what-you-use type of billing. Therefore, the cost can be predicted for financing and the overall maintenance. The physical hardware is decreased, and the chances of overhead can be for a scene shortly. Since the top platforms such as Amazon web service, Google Cloud platforms, and Microsoft Azure are widely used, there will be abundant resources in terms of troubleshooting, customer support, and tutorials on how to maintain and manage infrastructure as a service. Business operations can also be managed over the Internet due to this characteristic, which increases the likelihood of businesses adding on remote job positions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBenefits to infrastructure as a service include the reduction in expenditure when it comes to capital by getting rid of the need for physical hardware in terms of storage; since businesses will not have to focus on keeping up with and maintaining the infrastructure, these cloud providers, allow businesses to focus more on activities, and projects of their own, such as allowing their developers to work on coding. since infrastructure as a service provides virtual hardware, this will allow companies to use backup procedures in the event of a natural disaster, allowing businesses to run smoothly, even with natural disasters. Infrastructure as a service can be considered as a developer\u0026rsquo;s friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt allows them to test, tear down, and set up testing environments. For projects requiring an abundance of processing power, the scalability characteristic of infrastructure as a service allows for big data applications to run and be used and tested. Based on user needs and demand, businesses can host applications and skill resources over the Internet. They can also host websites on infrastructure as a service. storage is also a scalable factor in infrastructure as a service, and data can be stored for data-driven applications. With the platform as a service, customers do not have to worry about building and maintaining the overall infrastructure. Providers such as Amazon Web services, Elastic Being Stock, Google App engine, and Microsoft Azure app service allow customers to run and manage their applications. Debugging, version control, and integration development environments are tools embedded into the platform as a service; when moving from on-Premises to the cloud, companies need to consider if their data is integrative; platform as a service helps to get data from on-premises to integrate into these applications.\nSupport is also provided with application integration with middleware as well. Updates are also automatically installed in the underlying platform to decrease the complexities of compatibility when it comes to using the platform as a service. While maintaining underlying infrastructure, a platform as a service enhances productivity within a company because developers can focus on application development and running said projects. The development of collaborative environments and configured environments that allow time reduction to finish products and collaboration enhances the ability of the platform as a service with programming, languages, and tools supported by these providers so developers can experience more flexibility in their working environments. Complex enterprise applications can be supported by a platform as a service, back in services are provided as well to support both mobile and on-the-web applications, the creation and management of micro services, and the way that platform as a service simplifies, developing, testing in application deployment are all characteristics that make the platform as a service ideal for companies that delve in cloud computing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Over the Internet, software is delivered as a service. Without installing software, web browsers provide software as a service over the Internet. Google Workspace, Salesforce, and Microsoft Office 365 are diving examples of software as a service. Software as a service allows customers to run and deploy their applications over the Internet without maintaining the infrastructure to host them. Software as a service also offers security tools to enhance user data protection. Types of deployment models also include private cloud, public cloud, ivory cloud, community cloud, retro, private cloud, and inter–cloud. To highlight community cloud, organizations with the same interests, such as animal, husbandry, religion, or medical research, ideally use community cloud to offer marketing and can be hosted on-premise. Virtuali cloud offers affordable prices and unique features to accommodate unique business needs; an inter-cloud is a combination of all the clouds that use on-demand operations (Kansara \u0026amp; Patel, 2021).\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;A hybrid cloud is formed when using a mix of on-premises and third-party services, with an addition of public cloud and private cloud. This allows content and workload projects to be moved back and forth from the private to the public cloud (Pandit, 2020). The public cloud can be ideal for businesses that drive towards remote work; those who want to collaborate with others can work over the private cloud, and data centers are placed globally to facilitate and mitigate public cloud troubleshooting. Public cloud infrastructures are flexible enough to help developers test and deploy their applications. Startups and other small businesses can also gain advantages in using the public cloud because the pay-for-what-you-use model, also known as scalability, allows these types of businesses to save money and gain cloud services that can facilitate business growth by allocating resources towards staffing, projects, and marketing (Lande, 2024).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn conclusion, cloud computing development service models have helped organizations with their IT needs by offering scalable options and cost-effective solutions that are flexible and implementing high-security tools to help businesses grow in the cloud computing world. Infrastructure as a service, platform as a service, and software as a service helped businesses continue to Acclimate to the readily evolving, digital world by understanding and leveraging these service models and obtaining a competitive advantage over other companies using such efficient tools. By fostering these cloud service models, these businesses can meet specific needs when they use the full potential of these models. Scalability is a driving factor for most of these businesses\u0026rsquo; IT needs because cost-effectiveness is crucial when running a business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eResource allocation, as well as staffing and resources, also contribute to business growth. Using flexible infrastructure, companies can model and shape their underlying infrastructure. They can control their security measures and policies, implement tools to help developers with coding, and allow users to deploy and test their applications. Oh well, working over the Internet. It is also cost-effective because companies can implement remote work, promoting work efficiency when employees work from home. Businesses must understand what they need to develop service models for clubs. If they are looking for full control and flexibility of their infrastructure, they would also need to understand that the cost for maintenance and upkeep of physical hardware or virtual storage will need to be addressed. It is also crucial to know the costs of using these services. There are options for paying for what you use for the model.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;There are also payment models that charge a monthly subscription fee, which is an advantage. It can help businesses financially by allowing predictive financial analysis and detecting overhead. Security is also a big issue with using the cloud because virtual data is vulnerable to hackers and malware attacks and can cause serious financial damage to a business, especially if it is a startup or small business. Therefore, policies and procedures need to be implemented to ensure that safety audits are run regularly, security surveillance is also implemented, and data backup is also a policy factor that businesses take into account in the event of a natural disaster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCloud computing will continue to innovate with these ever-expanding technologies of the world and rapidly growing business needs.  It is predicted that morals will be the future technology infrastructure in the world. companies and government business owners would pivot to this technology to help their needs and customer basis. This  Model will be more secure  in a future to provide customer needs and to securely put their data in this infrastructure.\u003c/p\u003e\n","description":null,"image":null,"permalink":"http://localhost:1313/blogs/my-6-post/","title":"Infrastructure and Host Threats."},{"content":"\u003ch1
