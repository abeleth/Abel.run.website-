  <summary>What is DevOps?</summary>

## "From Amazon's standpoint, DevOps is a set of practices and cultural philosophies that enables organizations to improve collaboration between development and operations teams to automate and streamline the process of software development, deployment, and infrastructure management. At Amazon, DevOps is a key enabler of continuous innovation, allowing for faster delivery of applications, improvements, and services with a focus on customer satisfaction. Amazon emphasizes the use of AWS tools and services to automate infrastructure provisioning, continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD), and monitoring, fostering a rapid feedback loop to detect and resolve issues quickly. This approach enables teams to release software updates quickly, efficiently, and securely, maintaining high availability and reliability in a dynamic, cloud-based environment. Through practices like Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and automated testing, Amazon's DevOps culture aims to enhance operational efficiency, reduce downtime, and ensure that software aligns with customer needs and business objectives."

**Faster Time to Market:** By automating manual processes and integrating development with operations, DevOps enables rapid delivery of software features, updates, and fixes, reducing the time between writing code and making it available to users.

**Improved Collaboration:** DevOps breaks down silos between development, operations, and other teams, fostering a culture of shared responsibility, communication, and collaboration.

**Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD):** DevOps enables automated and continuous testing, integration, and delivery of code, ensuring that changes are deployed more frequently and reliably.

**Increased Efficiency and Automation:** By automating repetitive tasks such as testing, infrastructure provisioning, and deployment, DevOps helps reduce human error, increase productivity, and free up resources for higher-value tasks.

**Higher Quality and Reliability:** Through automated testing, monitoring, and feedback loops, DevOps ensures that software is of higher quality, with fewer bugs and vulnerabilities. Continuous monitoring allows for early detection and resolution of issues.

**Scalability and Flexibility:** DevOps practices, especially in cloud environments, enable teams to scale applications and infrastructure dynamically in response to changing business needs, traffic, and demand.

**Faster Incident Response and Recovery:** DevOps encourages continuous monitoring, quick issue detection, and rapid response to incidents, enabling teams to minimize downtime and recover from failures faster.

**Cost Efficiency:** Through automation and optimized infrastructure management (e.g., Infrastructure as Code), DevOps reduces operational costs by improving resource utilization and minimizing manual intervention.

**Security and Compliance:** DevOps incorporates security practices early in the development process (often called DevSecOps), ensuring that security is integrated into the pipeline, rather than being an afterthought.
