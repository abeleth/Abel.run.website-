ðŸŽ‰Deploying a Netflix Clone on Cloud with Jenkins: A DevSecOps JourneyðŸŽ‰

Iâ€™m excited to share a recent project I completed, where I combined my passion for DevOps, security, and cloud infrastructure to build a Netflix clone deployed on AWS using Jenkins, Docker and Terraform! ðŸŽ‰
ðŸ›  Tech Stack:
AWS EC2 with Ubuntu 
Docker for containerization
SonarQube & Trivy for code and image vulnerability scanning
Jenkins for CI/CD automation
Prometheus & Grafana for monitoring and visualization
API Integration with TMDB for movie data ðŸŽ¥
ðŸ“Œ Phases:
Initial Setup: Provisioned an EC2 instance, set up Docker, and deployed the Netflix clone using Docker containers.
Security: Integrated SonarQube and Trivy for static and dynamic security scanning.
CI/CD Pipeline: Set up Jenkins to automate the deployment process, integrated security tools, and Docker.
Monitoring: Installed Prometheus and Grafana to monitor the health of the application and the infrastructure.
ðŸ”‘ Key Takeaways:
Automated security scanning at every stage of the pipeline (from code to container images)
Used Jenkins for smooth and repeatable deployments, powered by Docker
Real-time monitoring with Grafana and Prometheus ensured constant insight into the app's performance
